# üì¶ OrderUp - Safe Ordering System

OrderUp is a **Spring Boot REST API** designed to process product orders safely and consistently.  
It guarantees **thread-safe stock updates** to prevent overselling and offers **centralized exception handling** for predictable, clean error responses.  
The project includes comprehensive **unit and integration tests** with **JaCoCo coverage reports** (currently at 86%, exceeding the 80%+ requirement for business logic and exception handling).

## üöÄ Features
- ‚úÖ Place an order for a product with concurrency safety.
- ‚úÖ Thread-safe stock updates preventing race conditions.
- ‚úÖ Centralized exception handling returning meaningful JSON errors.
- ‚úÖ DTO-based request/response for API clean separation.
- ‚úÖ Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for logging cross-cutting concerns.
- ‚úÖ Robust unit and integration tests with detailed coverage reports.

## üèó Design Overview

### 1. **Controller Layer**
- `OrderController` handles HTTP requests for placing orders.
- Accepts JSON input (`OrderRequest`), delegates to `OrderService`.
- Returns structured JSON response (`OrderResponse`).

### 2. **Service Layer**
- `OrderService` implements business logic:
  - Validates product existence.
  - Checks stock availability.
  - Deducts stock atomically using **synchronized blocks** to ensure **thread-safety** during concurrent orders.
- **Why synchronized?**  
  This simple yet effective mechanism prevents two threads from simultaneously reducing the stock, avoiding overselling without introducing complex distributed locks.

### 3. **Entity & DTOs**
- **Entities:** Represent database tables (`Product`, `Order`).
- **DTOs:** Data Transfer Objects separate persistence from API layer.
  - `OrderRequest`: Input payload with product ID, quantity, customer name.
  - `OrderResponse`: Output with order ID, status, and messages.

### 4. **Global Exception Handling**
- Implemented via `GlobalExceptionHandler` annotated with `@RestControllerAdvice`.
- Intercepts exceptions globally using Spring AOP under the hood.
- Maps domain exceptions to HTTP status codes:
  - `ProductNotFoundException` ‚Üí 404 Not Found.
  - `InsufficientStockException` ‚Üí 400 Bad Request.
  - Other exceptions ‚Üí 500 Internal Server Error.
- Returns consistent JSON error responses with timestamps for easier debugging.

### 5. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**
- Logging aspect intercepts service methods.
- Logs method entry, exit, and execution time.
- Separates cross-cutting concerns cleanly from business logic, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

## üîÑ Flow of an Order
Client ‚Üí OrderController ‚Üí OrderService ‚Üí Product Repository ‚Üí DB ‚Üí Response

Client sends order request:

POST /orders
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "productId": 1,
  "quantity": 2,
  "customerName": "Alice"
}


OrderController receives request and calls OrderService.

OrderService:

Validates product exists.

Checks and deducts stock inside a thread-safe block.

Creates order record.

Returns OrderResponse.

Successful response:

{
  "orderId": 101,
  "productId": 1,
  "quantity": 2,
  "status": "CONFIRMED",
  "message": "Order placed successfully"
}


Errors handled centrally and return structured JSON, e.g.:

{
  "error": "Product Not Found",
  "message": "Product not found with ID: 9999",
  "timestamp": 1694947200000
}
